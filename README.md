#Atm Machine 
The requirement was to create a text based atm machine. The atm machine had to display the users balance, accept a deposit, withdraw money, transfer money from checking to savings and vice versa, display the users information, update the users information if incorrect, and quit. The main method should only contain the interface functionality.
