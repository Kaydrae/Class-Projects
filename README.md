#Classroom Projects
This is a small collection of some of the coding proactices I have in my college classes.

#Atm Machine 
The requirement was to create a text based atm machine. The atm machine had to display the users balance, accept a deposit, withdraw money, transfer money from checking to savings and vice versa, display the users information, update the users information if incorrect, and quit. The main method should only contain the interface functionality. 

#Celsius to Fahrenheit
The requirement was to create a program that converted Celsius to Fahrenheit. The user would enter a temperature that’s in Celsius and the program would output that temperature in Fahrenheit. 

#Circle Math
The requirement was to create a program that did circle calculations. The user would enter the diameter and the program will output the radius, circumference and surface area.

#Fahrenheit to Celsius
The requirement was to create a program that converted Fahrenheit to Celsius. The user would enter a temperature that’s in Fahrenheit and the program would output that temperature in Celsius. 

#Final Webpage
The requirement for this webpage was to use examples of HTML and CSS. I made a Simpsons fan page, that contains gifs of my favorite episodes. 

#Fractions
The requirement was to make a program that has two classes, one contained all the math that can add, subtract, multiply, and divided fractions, display the fraction, and also a constructor that sets the program to 0/1. The main class calls the methods from the second class and used them to calculate that fraction need.  

#HiorLow
The requirement was to have the program randomly generate a number between 1 and 10 and have the user attempt to guess and after they get it right, output how many try’s it took. Also the whole game is protected by a password (thecode) as an example of string equality. If the user gets the password wrong three times the program quits. 

#HuttHike
The requirement was to have the program print out all the numbers between 0 and 100, and the numbers that are a multiples of 3 print “hutt”, and of the numbers are multiples of 7 print “hike.”

#PrimeNumbers
The requirement was to have the program ask the user for two numbers, and list all the prime numbers between those numbers. 

#RangeCheck
The requirement was to have the user enter a number between 1 and 30, and the program would output of the user was too high or too low. This had to be done by only using one if statement. 

#TicTacToe
The requirement was to make a fully working text based tic tac toe game. 

#mathStuff
The requirement was to make a program that has a parent class which includes methods to set the area and perimeter of a shape. Then have two classes that extend the shape class and have all the formulas of each shape to set the perimeter and area of the shape. The main class displays the calculations.
